This is setup to run from gulp, which requires the -g / global flag during install to use it form the command line

To invoke, just type gulp, which looks for the GuilpFile.js, and does the rest.

The port number in GulpFile.js is one off from the hard coded port number in App.js, which is done to distinguish
which method of invocation was used, either 'node App.js' or 'gulp'.

For a list of supported end-points, hit '/' or '/api/v1'.

ex) npm install body-parser --save

1. sudo npm install -g gulp
2. npm update
